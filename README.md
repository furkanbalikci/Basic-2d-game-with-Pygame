# Basic-2d-game-with-Pygame

I tried making a simple 2d game using the pygame module to increase my python and programming skills. There are two characters in this game and one is the enemy who is constantly moving, the other is the player character who has the ability to move left and right and shoot. You can see game footage in this link.
